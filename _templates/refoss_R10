If the plug keeps turning off for apparently no reason it is likely the wrong factory temperature calibration. Enter command ADCParam1 2, 4000,80000,4250,1 and restart the plug to fix.

Using GPIO5 as ButtonN results in sporadic resets of tasmota after a while. To use a button-switch set switchmode for switch1 to 4 for inverted pushbutton (default 0, 1 = toggle) by typing SwitchMode1 4 in console.
