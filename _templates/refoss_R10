##Connection

![Connection diagramm by Refoss](/assets/device_images/refoss_r10_connection-diagram1.webp)

*Warning: Avoid opening the rubber plug to access the debugging serial port while the device is powered on.
*Warning: Do not input AC high voltage into the DC 12V port.

Screw connections 
O: connects to Pin of relais (connect to lamp)
I: connects to other Pin of relais (connect to Live Wire)
L: 220V AC Live Wire
SW: Switch input to GPIO4 using 220V AC input 
12V: 12V DC input (testing, usage unclear, do not connect while using 220V AC)
N: Neutral AC

##Information

*If the plug keeps turning off for apparently no reason it is likely the wrong factory temperature calibration. Enter command ADCParam1 2, 4000,80000,4250,1 and restart the plug to fix.

*Does not schows Voltage, Current, Apparent Power, Reactive Power and Power Factor. Only Active Power and Energy Today/Yesterday/Total are showed (Tasmota 13.4.0). Seems to be a issue of CSE7766 / BL0937. May be an issue regarding to power monitoring calibration.

##Notes

*Hint: Do not change GPIO 5 to ButtonN 1. GPIO as ButtonN 1 results in sporadic resets of tasmota after a while (Tasmota 13.4.0). May be a result of screw connection header using 220V AC
for switching.  For use with Ac-conneted button-switches change SwitchMode of SwitchN 1 to inverted pushbutton (default 0, 1 = toggle works fine (Console -> SwitchMode1 4) by typing SwitchMode1 4 in console..
